Hello there! I work on creating AI that advances the world through the analysis and understanding of data. I specialize in delving deeply into complex data structures to clarify and extract valuable insights for problem-solving. Through various projects, I have strengthened data-driven decision-making and developed efficient algorithms for practical problem resolution. With these experiences, I aim to continuously learn and grow, enjoying new challenges in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.
